    "- **Encoding the Input Sequence:** The encoder component of the encoder-decoder RNN processes the input sequence and captures the contextual information into a fixed-length vector called the \"context vector\" or \"thought vector.\" This vector serves as a summary or representation of the input sequence and carries the relevant information to the decoder.\n",
    "\n",

It allows the model to generate a target sequence of words conditioned on the input sequence, leveraging the learned representation from the encoder.\n",

    "- **Handling Long-Term Dependencies:** Encoder-decoder RNNs can handle long-term dependencies between words in the input and output sequences. By utilizing the context vector, the decoder can access and utilize the information from earlier steps in the decoding process, enabling better translation quality."

Here's a high-level overview of the process:\n",

    "**RNN Sequence Modeling:** The reshaped feature sequence is then fed into an RNN, such as a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), which can model the temporal dependencies within the video. The RNN takes the sequence of feature vectors as input and generates hidden representations at each time step.\n",

    "1. ***Padding:*** You can pad the input sequences with a special token or zeros to make them of equal length. This allows you to process them efficiently in batches using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Padding ensures that all sequences have the same length, but you need to handle the padded values appropriately during computation.\n",
